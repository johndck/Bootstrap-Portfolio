To note: The intent of this assignment was to re-build to include Bootstrap, not re-design. This is my re-build using Bootstrap.

What is the application?

The application creates a responsive practice portfolio site for John Dick. The objective of the site is to showcase examples of John's front-end coding skills. The intention is update and develop this site as the bootcamp progresses.
